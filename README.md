# Fundamentals-and-Applications-of-AI- Pirate Treasure Hunt AI Project

Overview:

This repository contains the final project for the Fundamentals and Applications of AI course. The project involves developing advanced agents for a pirate ship navigation problem, utilizing various AI algorithms to optimize treasure collection in a stochastic and competitive environment.

Project Parts:

1: One Piece Pirate Treasure Hunt-
Developed an agent to navigate a grid-based environment, collect treasures, and avoid Marine ships using search algorithms and heuristic functions.

2: Stochastic Pirate Treasure Hunt-
Enhanced the agent to handle probabilistic behaviors and optimize decision-making in an uncertain environment.

3: Competitive Pirate Fleet Navigation-
Implemented two agents, including a UCT-based agent, to compete against an opponent's fleet in a dynamic environment.
